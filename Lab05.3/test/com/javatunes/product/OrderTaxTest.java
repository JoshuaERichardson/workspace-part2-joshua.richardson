  /**
   * TODO: (for each of the test cases below)
   * 1. Create an order for *each* cart in the setup, e.g., Order order1 = new Order(...)
   * 2. Remember to call order1.processCart(cart1) -> that method computes the order's total cost.
   * 3. DEPENDING ON YOUR IMPLEMENTATION, initialize somehow the Order's TaxCalculator strategy.
   *     - For example, if you wrote a factory for TaxCalculator (option 1), make sure the Order has a Location set,
   *       since the factory (most likely) is using this to determine which strategy to provide.
   *     - If you are injecting the TaxCalculator into the Order (option 2, perhaps from an OrderFactory), use that 
   *       factory to create the Orders.
   *     - If you're injecting the TaxCalculator from the client, do so here.
   * 4. Verify that the order's tax is as expected.
   * 
   * TEST NOTE: you can split the two orders per location into two test cases, if desired.
